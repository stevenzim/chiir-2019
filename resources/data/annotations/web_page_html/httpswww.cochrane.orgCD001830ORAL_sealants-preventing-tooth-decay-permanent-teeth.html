<b>Review question</b>
</p>
<p>Can sealants prevent tooth decay in permanent teeth and what are the effects of different types of sealants?</p>
<p>
<b>Background</b>
</p>
<p>Although children and adolescents have healthier teeth than in the past, tooth decay is a problem in some people and places. Most tooth decay in young people occurs on the biting surfaces of back teeth. Tooth decay prevention includes brushing, fluoride supplements (such as tablets), fluoride directly applied to the teeth and dental sealants. Dental sealants aim to prevent bacteria growth that promote tooth decay in grooves of back teeth. Sealants are applied by dentists or dental care team members. The main types used are resin-based sealants and glass ionomer cements.</p>
<p>
<b>Study characteristics</b>
</p>
<p>We included 38 studies that involved 7924 young people (aged 5 to 16 years) among whom a variety of dental sealants was used to prevent tooth decay. Young people in the studies represented the general <span class="lexicon-term" title="This term can refer to the participants involved in a healthcare study; it can also refer to a general population of people."><abbr title="This term can refer to the participants involved in a healthcare study; it can also refer to a general population of people.">population</abbr></span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="lexicon-term" title="In the Cochrane context, this refers to a ‘systematic review’. In the broader healthcare context it refers to any attempt to synthesise the results of more than one study on a particular topic area."><abbr title="In the Cochrane context, this refers to a ‘systematic review’. In the broader healthcare context it refers to any attempt to synthesise the results of more than one study on a particular topic area.">review</abbr></span> includes studies available from a search of the literature up to 3 August 2016. We assessed all studies as being at high <span class="lexicon-term" title="A way of expressing the chance of an event taking place, expressed as the number of events divided by the total number of observations or people.

<p>
<b>Key results</b>
</p>
<p>Fifteen studies compared resin-based sealants to no sealants and found that children who had sealant applied to their back teeth were less likely to have tooth decay in their back teeth than children with no sealant. We were able to combine <span class="lexicon-term" title="Data is the information collected through research. It can include written information, numbers, sounds and pictures.

"><abbr title="Data is the information collected through research. It can include written information, numbers, sounds and pictures. It is usually stored on computer, so that it can be analysed, interpreted and then communicated to others, for example in reports, graphs or diagrams.
">data</abbr></span> from seven of these studies (including two published since 2010), which involved children who were aged from 5 to 10 years when the sealants were applied. This showed that if 40% of back teeth develop decay over 24 months, using sealant reduces this to 6%. Similar benefits for resin-based sealants were shown up to four years. The effect appeared to persist when measured up to nine years, but there was less evidence.</p>
<p>Results were inconclusive when glass ionomer-based sealant was compared with no sealant and when one type of sealant material was compared with another.</p>
<p>Four studies assessed possible problems from using sealants; none were reported.</p>
<p>
<b>Quality of the evidence</b>
</p>
<p>We found moderate-quality evidence that resin-based sealant is more effective than no sealant for preventing tooth decay, reducing it by between 11% and 51% more than in children without sealant (measured two years after application). 'Moderate quality' means we are reasonably certain of this finding, although it is possible that future <span class="lexicon-term" title="The term research means different things to different people, but is essentially about finding out new knowledge that could lead to changes to treatments, policies or care.

There is bound to be some uncertainty in estimates because studies are conducted on samples and not entire populations.
By convention, 95% certainty is considered high enough for researchers to draw conclusions that can be generalised from samples to populations. If we are comparing two groups using relative measures, such as relative risks or odds ratios, and see that the 95% CI includes the value of one in its range, we can say that there is no difference between the groups. This confidence interval tells us that, at least some of the time, the ratio of effects between the groups is one. Similarly, if an absolute measure of effect, such as a difference in means between groups, has a 95% CI that includes zero in its range, we can conclude there is no difference between the groups.
