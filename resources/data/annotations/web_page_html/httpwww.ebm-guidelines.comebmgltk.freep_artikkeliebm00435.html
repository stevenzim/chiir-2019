<h2 id="s1">Essentials</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sufficient time for the survey of the history and for the physical examination of the patient</li><li>
Early recognition of serious causes of back pain and of nerve root compression</li><li>Organization of further investigations and treatment without delay in situations where conservative treatment may lead to complications (cauda equina, severe functional disorders of nerves, and other critical "red flag" situations). In such situations the treatment should be organized in a unit capable of urgent MRI and other investigations.</li><li>
Adequate treatment of pain: according to the intensity of pain the choice is paracetamol, a NSAID or a combination of a NSAID and a mild opioid analgesic</li><li>Avoidance of bed rest</li>

<li>Continuation or resumption of ordinary daily activities as soon  as possible</li>



<li>Provision of adequate and truthful   patient information: the pain will resolve but  has a tendency to recur</li>
<li>Follow-up of the patient and restoration of his/her  functional capacity</li><li>In prolonged low back pain that has lasted for at least 6 weeks: confirmation of the diagnosis, multidisciplinary and active rehabilitation as well as   assessment of the patient&#x2019;s psychosocial  situation</li><li>
In chronic low back pain that has lasted for more than 3 months: intensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 id="s2">Epidemiology</h2>
<ul>
<li>Low back pain is a very common condition: nearly 80% of  people experience a disabling low back pain at some point in their  lives.</li>
<li>Of all patients in general practice 4&#x2013;6% of working  age women and 5&#x2013;7% of working age men present with low back pain as their  main complaint.</li>
<li>It is estimated that 15% to 20% of adults have back pain during a single year and 50% to 80% experience at least one episode of back pain during a lifetime. At any one time, about 15% of adults have low back pain.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 id="s3">Clinical examination</h2>
<div class="section">
<h3>History</h3>
<ul>
<li>Taking a history is the most important part in the clinical examination of a back pain patient. Data obtained from the history can be classified as follows: <ul>
<li>Earlier low back pain (onset of symptoms, visits at a doctor, earlier investigations, treatments and sick leaves)</li>
<li>Current low back pain (onset, nature and intensity of symptoms, pain and sensory disturbances in the lower extremity, perceived disability in daily living, investigations, treatments and their effectiveness)</li>
<li>Other illnesses (operations, traumas, other musculoskeletal disorders, other diseases such as diabetes and arteriosclerosis in lower extremities, diseases of the urogenital system, allergies, current medication)</li>
<li>Social history (couple relationship, family, education)</li>
<li>Lifestyle (physical exercise, leisure time activities, smoking, use of alcohol and drugs, diet)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3>Physical examination</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the physical examination, emphasis is placed on the detection of possible serious disease and signs of nerve root compression as well as on the assessment of functional capacity. The patient should undress to a sufficient degree. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Inspection of the spine <ul>
<li>Flattening of lordosis or scoliosis due to acute pain</li>
<li>Bending of the lumbar spine; painful restriction may indicate the degree of severity.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Examination of the mobility of the back <ul>
<li>Restriction in bending forward, backward and sideways may give a picture of the severity of the back pain.</li><li>
Mobility of the spine and disturbances in the rhythm of motion provide understanding of the functional capacity of the back, and measuring the mobility is of significance in follow-up of the condition.</li><li> 
The adjusted Schober test has moderate repeatability in measuring the mobility.</li><li>
The rotational motion of the spine and the mobility of the thorax become early restricted in ankylosing spondylitis  <a class="a article" title="Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis" href="ltk.free?p_artikkeli=ebm00443"><span class="title">«Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis»</span><span class="text">1</span></a>.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Assessment of signs of nerve root compression <ul>
<li>Straight leg raising (SLR) and Lasègue's test are sensitive but non-specific tests for verifying nerve root compression at S1 and L5 level.<ul>
<li>The tests are interpreted as positive when they cause pain radiating from the back to the lower limb. Back pain itself or tightness behind the knee are not positive signs.</li>
<li>In nerve root compression, passive dorsiflexion of the foot during SLR test increases the pain radiating from the back to the limb.</li>
<li>Crossing pain: Intensified radiating pain when raising the contralateral limb is a specific sign of nerve root compression.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Muscular strength of the lower limbs <ul>
<li>Knee extension (L4 and partially L3 nerve root)</li>
<li>Dorsiflexion of the ankle (L5, partially L4 nerve root), dorsiflexion of the big toe (L5 root) and plantar flexion of the ankle (S1 nerve root) </li>
<li>Walking on heels (L5, partially L4 nerve root) or on toes (S1 root)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tendon reflexes <ul>
<li>Patella (L4 nerve root)</li>
<li>Achilles (S1 nerve root)</li>
<li>Babinski (upper motor neuron)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Patients with lower limb symptoms are examined for sense of touch on the lower medial side of the knee (L4 nerve root), medial (L5 nerve root), dorsal (L5 nerve root) and lateral (S1 nerve root) sides of the foot.</li>
<li>Decreased muscle strength of both legs (paraparesis), enhanced or multiple tendon reflexes, and a positive Babinski's sign suggest a need for neurological or neurosurgical assessment. Paraparesis is an indication for immediate referral to a hospital with a possibility to urgently carry out an MRI examination and to perform potential surgery.</li>
<li>Rectal touch (tonus of the sphincter) and the sense of touch of the perineum should be examined when cauda equina syndrome is suspected (immediate referral).</li>
</ul>
</li><li>Palpation of the vertebrae, sciatic nerves and lower extremities <ul>
<li>Numerous tender points and associate symptoms may suggest e.g. fibromyalgia  <a class="a article" title="Fibromyalgia" href="ltk.free?p_artikkeli=ebm00395"><span class="title">«Fibromyalgia»</span><span class="text">2</span></a>. </li><li>Palpation or Doppler ultrasonography, or both, of the arteries in the lower extremities in patients over 50 years of age with intermittent claudication  <a class="a article" title="Lower limb ischaemia" href="ltk.free?p_artikkeli=ebm00101"><span class="title">«Lower limb ischaemia»</span><span class="text">3</span></a></li>

<div class="section">
<h2 id="s4">Psychosocial risk factors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Psychosocial factors may impede recovery, prolong and complicate functional capacity problems and alter pain behaviour. Factors suggesting an increased risk for chronicity ("yellow flags") are presented in table  <a class="a table" title="Factors suggesting an increased risk for chronicity of back pain" href="#T1"><span class="title">«Factors suggesting an increased risk for chronicity of back pain»</span><span class="text">1</span></a>.</li>

<h2 id="s5">Classification of diagnostic urgency</h2>
<ul>
<li>Uncommon but serious causes of back pain should be recognized at an early stage. Also, signs of sciatic syndrome should be recognized.</li>
<li>Back symptoms can be divided into 3 categories on the basis of the history and the findings in clinical examination. <ol class="decimal">
<li>Possible serious (tumour, infection, fracture, cauda equina syndrome) or specific disease (ankylosing spondylitis); see table  <a class="a table" title="The most common serious or specific causes for low back pain and urgency of referral" href="#T2"><span class="title">«The most common serious or specific causes for low back pain and urgency of referral»</span><span class="text">2</span></a></li>
<li>Symptoms in the lower limbs suggesting nerve root dysfunction (sciatic syndrome, intermittent claudication) </li>

<h2 id="s10">Sciatic syndrome  <a class="a evd_group " href="plugin/evdgroup?p_id=evd00874"><span class="text">evd</span></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The most common reason for an acute sciatic syndrome is intervertebral disc herniation.</li>
<li>If the indications for emergency investigations and surgery (see below) are not fulfilled, conservative treatment of a patient with sciatica may be continued for 6 weeks before consideration of surgery. Chronic sciatica are caused by spinal stenosis  <a class="a article" title="Lumbar spinal stenosis" href="ltk.free?p_artikkeli=ebm00436"><span class="title">«Lumbar spinal stenosis»</span><span class="text">4</span></a>, i.e. narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal or the intervertebral nerve root canals.</li>
<li>In sciatic syndrome caused by intervertebral disc herniation the patient may move around and act within the limits of pain  <a class="a evidence" title="Advice to rest in bed appears to be less effective than advice to stay active for people with acute low-back pain. For patients with sciatica, there is little or no difference between the two approaches." href="ltk.free?p_artikkeli=evd04843"><span class="title">«Advice to rest in bed appears to be less effective than advice to stay active for people with acute low-back pain. For patients with sciatica, there is little or no difference between the two approaches.»</span><span class="text">B</span></a>. Motion may be recommended in order to maintain general vitality and functional capacity. Sometimes severe sciatic pain necessitates bed rest; the so-called psoas position often relieves the symptoms.</li>
<li>Surgical discectomy provides faster pain relief than conservative management for carefully selected patients with sciatica  <a class="a evidence" title="Surgical discectomy for carefully selected patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc prolapse appears to provide faster pain relief than conservative management, although any positive or negative long-term effects are unclear.

<ul>
<li>If the pain is tolerable, if there are no signs of neurological deficits and if, based on patient history or findings, there is no reason to suspect a severe disease or a disease that requires specific treatment, the treatment is carried out based on the patient history and clinical examination as symptomatic therapy.</li>
<li>The benign nature and the good spontaneous healing tendency of the condition are emphasized to the patient.</li>
<li>Sick leave is considered on an individual basis. Short sick leave is usually sufficient. The aim is that the patient returns back to work after the sick leave.</li>

<div class="section">
<h3>Avoidance of bed rest and continuation of regular activities</h3>
<ul>
<li>The patient is advised to avoid bed rest  <a class="a evidence" title="Advice to rest in bed appears to be less effective than advice to stay active for people with acute low-back pain. For patients with sciatica, there is little or no difference between the two approaches." href="ltk.free?p_artikkeli=evd04843"><span class="title">«Advice to rest in bed appears to be less effective than advice to stay active for people with acute low-back pain.

<li>The patient is encouraged to continue ordinary daily activities or resume them as soon as possible. Pain allowing, the patient can use his/her back within reasonable limits, and there is usually no need to restrict continuation of fairly light work.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3>Analgesics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Due to its safety, paracetamol is the first-line analgesic, unless the patient has strong pain. The patient should be instructed to take sufficiently large doses of paracetamol, but the daily dose should not exceed 3 000 mg. Nevertheless, paracetamol is not superior to placebo in alleviating low back pain or reducing the length of pain  <a class="a evidence" title="Paracetamol is no better than placebo for relieving acute low back pain (LBP).

A risk of intestinal, cardiac and renal adverse effects is associated with the use of all NSAIDs; see  <a class="a article" title="Safe use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)" href="ltk.free?p_artikkeli=ebm00883"><span class="title">«Safe use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)»</span><span class="text">5</span></a>.</li><li>If paracetamol and a NSAID are not sufficient, the effect of pain medication may be increased by adding an opioid (codein in a combination product, or tramadol).</li>




</ul>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3>Muscle relaxants</h3>
<ul>
<li>Muscle relaxants are more effective than placebo, but they are no more effective than NSAIDs, and the combination of muscle relaxants and NSAIDs brings no further benefit  <a class="a evidence" title="Muscle relaxants are more effective than placebo for low back pain, but their use is associated with frequent adverse effects, especially drowsiness and dizziness." href="ltk.free?p_artikkeli=evd02008"><span class="title">«Muscle relaxants are more effective than placebo for low back pain, but their use is associated with frequent adverse effects, especially drowsiness and dizziness.»</span><span class="text">A</span></a>.</li>

<h3>Investigations</h3>
<ul>
<li>If back pain is prolonged, further investigations for the confirmation of diagnosis, for the appraisal of treatment and, if needed, for the drawing up of a comprehensive rehabilitation plan should be performed after 6 weeks from the onset of symptoms. Consultation with a physiatrist, orthopaedist, rheumatologist or neurosurgeon is often needed to assess the diagnosis (special examinations), treatment, functional and working capacity and need for rehabilitation.</li>
<li>It is worthwhile to assess the patient's illness behaviour, exhaustion and depression  in an interview and by pain drawings and questionnaires that the patient fills in him- or herself (e.g. Oswestry).</li>

<h3>Drug therapy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Basic approach to drug therapy is the same as with acute low back pain.</li>
<li>The adverse effects of analgesics in prolonged use must be considered especially in the elderly who are at risk of developing serious peptic ulcer perforations as a complication of NSAIDs. All NSAIDs can cause cardiovascular complications.</li>
