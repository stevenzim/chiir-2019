			<p>Do you suffer with low back pain, neck pain or carpal tunnel?</p>
			<p>Have you been told you need neck or back surgery? <br><br>Decompression 
			Traction Therapy is an effective treatment for these conditions. It 
			is very affordable and less expensive than surgery. </p>
			<p>Decompression Traction Therapy is the hottest new therapeutic device 
			for treatment of painful nerve compression and disc herniation syndromes!</p>
			<p>
			<img align="right" border="0" height="201" src="images/dts-005.jpg" width="251">The 
			Decompression-Reduction-Stabilization therapy is an effective treatment 
			for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Herniated disc</li>
				<li>Degenerative disc</li>
				<li>Facet syndrome</li>
				<li>Sciatica</li>
				<li>Post-surgical patients</li>
				<li>Spinal Stenosis</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Do you have a herniated disc, multiple herniated discs, degenerative 
			disc disease, facet syndrome, or any other type of spinal problem? Is 
			your doctor suggesting surgery, Pain Management, or Physical Therapy? 
			Have you tried Chiropractic and just could not get enough relief? Come 
			to Hopkins Clinic for Physical Medicine and try out the Decompression 
			Traction System (Triton DTS).</p>
			<p>Research indicates the disc is responsible for a significant number 
			of lumbar/leg pain and neck/arm pain syndromes. Compression increases 
			intradiscal pressure leading to annular compromise and possible extrusion 
			of nuclear material.</p>
			<p>Since the disc is an avascular structure, it doesn't receive fresh 
			blood and oxygen with every beat of the heart. It requires &quot;diffusion&quot; 
			created by motion and 'Decompression' to restore nutrients and enhance 
			healing.</p>
			<p class="center">
			<img border="0" height="200" src="images/dts-004.jpg" width="320"></p>
			<p>Decompression is defined as reduction in pressure (intradiscal). 
			Recumbent positions (both prone and supine) decrease intradiscal pressures 
			in comparison to standing and sitting. However focused, axial mechanical+Y 
			translation <em>traction</em>, (creating 'Decompression' i.e. unloading 
			due to distraction and positioning) has been shown to reduce disc pressure 
			and enhance the healing response even further.</p>
			<p>
			<img align="left" border="0" height="128" src="images/P2.jpg" width="130">There 
			is some suggestion in the literature that extruded nuclear material 
			may be &quot;drawn in&quot; by the reduction of intradiscal pressures. 
			This concept however is not uniformly accepted since the length of time 
			the material stays 'drawn in' has not been established in controlled 
			studies. However, a temporary reduction in intradiscal pressure can 
			still have a profound effect on the healing process via increased contact 
			with the blood supply and fibroblast migration (so called phasic effects). 
			This is in addition to the pain relief created neurologically by stretching 
			soft tissue (e.g. stretch receptors, mechanoreceptors etc.) make Decompression 
			Traction Therapy a logical and viable addition to a &quot;passive&quot; 
			pain care regiment.</p>
			<p>Clinically it is important to establish criteria both in the utilization 
			of <em>Decompression</em> Traction Therapy and in defining its utility. 
			(As with many therapies, hyperbole and overstatement are common.) Axial 
			Decompression (both lumbar and cervical) is first and foremost a &quot;passive&quot; 
			therapy and as such has definite limitations in &quot;curing&quot; a 
			chronic musculoskeletal condition. Its value is most specific in helping
			<em>referral</em> pain not solely low back or acute low back pain (symptoms 
			for which manipulation has proven beneficial).</p>
			<p>Loss of local muscle control, abnormal posture and alterations in 
			spinal curves are the probable underlying source of most spinal 'compression' 
			and degeneration. Therefore a &quot;passive&quot; therapy has little 
			effect in truly <em>fixing</em> the underlying problem.</p>
			<p>However, that being said, Decompression Traction Therapy (done safely 
			within established protocols and a clear understanding of it's limitations) 
			can often effectively enhance the healing process and render quick, 
			effective and often amazing pain relief in a properly selected patient 
			population (many who have previously failed other treatments). Additionally 
			it may also be very useful in determining the overall prognosis of passive 
			care and expediting the phase-in of rehab protocols.</p>
			<h2>Spinal Decompression Therapy Fees</h2>
			<p>The fee for up to a 30 minute Decompression traction is $55. An examination 
			fee is also required prior to initiation of Decompression traction for 
			patients who are new to Hopkins Clinic. This is usually $185. No &quot;treatment 
			plans&quot; or &quot;treatment packages&quot; are sold to the patient 
			as each patient responds differently to treatment and it is impossible 
			to determine how many treatments the patient may need. A trial of 6 
			visits at 3 times a week for 2 weeks is recommended to see how the patient 
			responds. If the patient has not sustained notable improvement with 
			this trial, continued Decompression traction is not further recommended. 
			If the patient reports modest or significant improvement, continued 
			therapy is indicated. Recommendations to include core exercise and strengthening 
			instruction with our physical therapist is recommended but not required. 
			Examination fees and physical therapy fees are often covered by private 
			insurance companies. Additional physical therapy modalities are available 
			on site to include electric muscle stimulation, moist heat, cryotherapy, 
			ultrasound, etc.</p>
			<h2>Spinal Decompression Indications and Use</h2>
			<p>Any non-acute (&gt;1 week) low back or neck pain syndrome not related 
			to a disease process, canal stenosis or acute strain/sprain injury is 
			theoretically treatable by Decompression. Disc and facet pain can often 
			be relieved by early intervention with Decompression. The acute inflammation 
			of injuries, however, should be reduced by other means, in most cases, 
			prior to beginning Decompression. Contraindications are similar to manipulative 
			therapy, however since mechanical stretch creates no impact, mild to 
			moderate Osteoporosis may not be contraindicated. (This holds true overall 
			for frail and elderly patients who could potentially be injured by manipulative 
			thrusts. Disc fragmentation, calcification, severe arthritis and any 
			surgical spinal appliances are all relative contraindications.</p>
			<p>Our clinical findings suggest Decompression will create a relatively
			<em>quick</em> initial response. Patients who will do well tend to feel 
			a sense of relief (which can be direct pain cessation or a <em>centralization</em> 
			of pain and/or reduction to an ache or stiffness) within <strong>six</strong> 
			sessions. Full relief, if attainable through this passive treatment 
			will usually be in <strong>8-12</strong> sessions. (Occasionally a 'stubborn' 
			pain syndrome may continue to improve slowly over 15+ sessions though 
			this is not the norm). Often patients will be treated <strong>4-6</strong> 
			sessions and notice enough relief to allow active rehab to begin. Their 
			Decompression may continue (<em>pre or post</em> rehab depending on 
			the methods chosen) for <strong>4-6</strong> further sessions before 
			discontinuing or reducing the frequency.</p>
			<p>Typical frequency is <strong>3-5</strong> times per week. The extent 
			and seriousness of the symptoms will determine if more than three sessions 
			per week should be utilized. Our experience suggests Decompression is 
			also an excellent supportive or maintenance treatment for those cases 
			where pain relief is marked but prone to exacerbations.</p>
			<p>Spinal Disc Decompression, utilizing&nbsp; Decompression-Reduction-Stabilization, 
			is a unique, non-surgical therapy developed for the treatment of chronic 
			lower back pain, herniated discs and degenerative disc diseases. </p>

			Decompression-Reduction-Stabilization therapy is an effective treatment

			<ul>
				<li>Herniated disc</li>

			<p>The Spinal Decompression Table in conjunction with additional modalities 
			effectively relieves the pain and disability resulting from disc injury 
			and degeneration, by repairing damaged discs and reversing dystrophic 
			changes in nerves. Spinal Disc Decompression addresses the functional 
			and mechanical aspects of discogenic pain and disease through non-surgical 
			Decompression of lumbar intervertebral discs. Studies verify the significant 
			reduction of intradiscal pressures into the negative range, to approximately 
			minus 150 mm/HG, which result in the non-surgical Decompression of the 
			disc and nerve root. Conventional traction has never demonstrated a 
			reduction of intradiscal pressure to negative ranges; on the contrary 
			- many traction devices actually increased intradiscal pressure, most 
			likely due to reflex muscle spasm. The Decompression Table is designed 
			to apply distraction tension to the patient’s lumbar spine without eliciting 
			reflex paravertebral muscle contractions.</p>
			<p>By significantly reducing intradiscal pressure, Spinal Disc Decompression 
			promotes retraction of the herniation into the disc and facilitates 
			influx of oxygen, proline and other substrates. The promotion of fibro 
			elastic activity stimulates repair and inhibits leakage of irritant 
			sulphates and carboxylates from the nucleus. The most recent trial sought 
			to correlate clinical success with MRI evidence of disc repair in the 
			annulus, nucleus, facetjoint and foramina as a result of treatment and 
			found that reduction of disc herniation ranged between 10% and 90% depending 
			on the number of sessions performed, while annulus patching and healing 
			was evident in all cases.</p>
			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<p>What is Spinal Decompression Traction Therapy?<br>Spinal Decompression 
			Traction Therapy is a non-surgical, comfortable traction therapy for 
			the relief of back and leg pain or neck and arm pain. During this procedure, 
			by cycling through distraction and relaxation phases and by proper positioning, 
			a spinal disc can be isolated and placed under negative pressure, causing 
			a vacuum effect within it. </p>
			<p>What can this vacuum effect do?<br>The vacuum effect accomplishes 
			two things. From a mechanical standpoint, disc material that has protruded 
			or herniated outside the normal confines of the disc can be pulled back 
			within the disc by the vacuum created within the disc. Also, the vacuum 
			within the disc stimulates in growth of blood supply, secondarily stimulating 
			a healing response. This results in pain reduction and proper healing 
			at the injured site.</p>
			<p>What machine is used for this purpose?<br>There are a number of spinal 
			Decompression machines presently used in the United States. After significant 
			research, Hopkins Clinic for Physical Medicine has chosen to use the 
			Triton DTS machine manufactured by Chattanooga, Inc., the premier manufacturer 
			of physical therapy machines.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Who can benefit from Spinal Decompression Traction Therapy?<br>Spinal 
			Decompression Traction Therapy is designed to unload the spinal disc. 
			Any back pain or neck pain caused in whole or in part by a damaged disc 
			may be helped by spinal Decompression Traction Therapy. These conditions 
			include herniated, protruding or bulging discs, spinal stenosis, sciatica 
			or radiculopathy (pinched nerves).</p>
			<p>Are there conditions where Spinal Decompression is not indicated?<br>
			Spinal Decompression Traction Therapy is usually not recommended for 
			pregnant women, or patients who have severe osteoporosis, severe obesity 
			or severe nerve damage. It is not recommended for patients over 70. 
			However, every patient is evaluated on an individual basis.&nbsp; Spinal 
			surgery with instrumentation (screws and metal plates or “cages”) is 
			also contraindicated.&nbsp; Surgery to the discs without fusion or fusion 
			using bony replacement is not contraindicated.</p>
			<p>How often do I take treatment sessions?&nbsp; How long does each 
			session last?<br>Each session includes Decompression Traction Therapy 
			and spinal stabilization exercises and takes about 1 hour. Spinal Decompression 
			is usually performed 3-5 times a week for 15-20 sessions.</p>
			<p>I have had spinal surgery, but continue to have pain.&nbsp; Can I 
			try Spinal Decompression Traction Therapy?<br>Spinal Decompression Traction 
			Therapy can help people with back pain after failed spinal surgery. 
			It can be performed in most patients who have not been left with an 
			unstable spine after surgery. </p>
			<p>How can I be scheduled for Spinal Decompression Traction Therapy?<br>
			Simply call our office at 727-544-3330 and tell the receptionist that 
			you are interested in Decompression Traction Therapy.&nbsp; An initial 
			consultation can usually be scheduled within 48 hours.</p>
