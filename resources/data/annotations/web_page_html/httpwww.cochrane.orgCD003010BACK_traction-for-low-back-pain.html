Some patients also had sciatica. We examined the effects of traction immediately after the traction session, in the short-term (up to three months after traction) and in the long-term (around one year after traction).</p>
<p>LBP is a major health problem around the world and is a major cause of medical expenses, absenteeism and disability. One treatment option for LBP that has been used for thousands of years is traction, the application of a force that draws two adjacent bones apart from each other in order to increase their shared joint space. Various types of traction are used, often in combination with other treatments. The most commonly used traction techniques are mechanical or motorized traction (where the traction is exerted by a motorized pulley) and manual traction (in which the traction is exerted by the therapist, using his or her body weight to alter the force and direction of the pull).</p>
<p>The evidence is current to August 2012. The <span class="lexicon-term" title="In the Cochrane context, this refers to a ‘systematic review’. In the broader healthcare context it refers to any attempt to synthesise the results of more than one study on a particular topic area."><abbr title="In the Cochrane context, this refers to a ‘systematic review’.

Most studies included a similar <span class="lexicon-term" title="This term can refer to the participants involved in a healthcare study; it can also refer to a general population of people."><abbr title="This term can refer to the participants involved in a healthcare study; it can also refer to a general population of people.">population</abbr></span> of people with LBP with and without sciatica.

Most studies reported follow-up of one to 16 weeks, and a limited number of studies reported long-term follow-up of six months to one year.</p>
<p>The included studies show that traction as a single treatment or in combination with physiotherapy is no more effective in treating LBP than sham (pretend) treatment, physiotherapy without traction or other treatment methods including exercise, laser, <span class="lexicon-term" title="The use of sound waves to examine parts of the body.

There was no difference regarding the type of traction (manual or mechanical).</p>
<p>Side effects were reported in seven of the 32 studies and included increased pain, aggravation of neurological signs and subsequent surgery. Four studies reported that there were no side effects. The remaining studies did not mention side effects.</p>
<p>The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. There was a scarcity of high-quality studies, especially those that distinguished between people with different symptom patterns (with and without sciatica, with pain of different duration).</p> </div></div></div><div tabindex="7" class="required-fields group-abstract"><div class="field field-name-field-abstract-conclusion field-type-text-long field-label-above">

<b>Implications for practice</b>
<br />To date, the use of traction as treatment for non-specific LBP cannot be motivated by the best available evidence. These conclusions are applicable to both manual and mechanical traction.</p>
