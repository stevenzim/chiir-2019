<font size="2">

<p align="center">This is a list of side effects that may result<br>from the use of benzodiazepines:</p>

<p align="center"><b>So-called "Paradoxical" Effects</b></p>

<p align="justify">According to <a href="lader2.htm">Professor Malcolm Lader</a>, 5% of those using benzodiazepines may
be affected by so-called "paradoxical" reactions in response to the drugs
rather than the desired tranquillising effects. Such reactions include
increased aggressiveness (in some individuals even violent behaviour),
depression (with or without suicidal thoughts or intentions), and sometimes
personality changes. In some instances, reactions such as hallucinations,
depersonalisation, derealisation and other psychiatric symptoms occur.</p>

<p align="justify">Ativan (lorazepam) and Halcion (triazolam) in particular may produce
dissociation and other psychiatric symptoms.</p>

<p align="justify">"Paradoxical" side effects occur in all age groups but are more likely to be
found in children and in the elderly where they may be fairly frequent yet
erroneously diagnosed as various psychiatric disorders.  The risk of such
reactions is generally greater with short-acting compounds but may occur
with all benzodiazepine drugs.  It is important to remember that the
"paradoxical" reactions can also be encountered in short-term use and, in
rare cases, even following the first ingestion of the drug.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Long-term Side Effects</b></p>

<p align="justify">All the psychological changes mentioned above may occur as long-term side
effects when the use (or abuse) has become chronic i.e. has been going on
for many months or even years.  The frequency of such side effects is
significantly higher than the frequency of "paradoxical" side effects.  The
long-term effects include depression, querulousness or aggression, and
subtle personality changes.   Further, fatigue, passivity and symptoms of
memory and cognitive impairment may ensue.</p>

<p align="justify">Tolerance with inter-dose withdrawal exists when the originally prescribed
dosage no longer produces the original effect, and the patient experiences
drug withdrawal although he/she is still taking the preparation.  This may
lead to an increase of dosage, or more often, result in long-term use.  Over
time, the above-mentioned long-term side effects may develop.  The risk of
this course of events is greater with compounds with short half-lives such
as Ativan (lorazepam), Halcion (triazolam), Xanax (alprazolam), Rohypnol
(flunitrazepam) and even Serax/Serenid (oxazepam).  In addition to the
symptomatology described under "Paradoxical Effects", phobias, OCD, and
various neurological symptoms such as tinnitus may occur as long-term side
effects.</p>

<p align="center"><B>Psychomotor Side Effects</b></p>

<p align="justify">Benzodiazepines may cause psychomotor impairment, and several studies have
shown an increased risk of road accidents in drivers under the influence of
benzodiazepine drugs.  The risk of other accidents, for example in
industrial workshops, may be increased as well.  The elderly are
particularly vulnerable to these psychomotor effects and may also develop
dysarthria and ataxia. The risk of falls and fractures is pronounced in
this population when tranquillisers are used on a regular basis.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Cognitive Side Effects</b></p>

<p align="justify">Memory functioning is markedly and measurably impaired, especially the
ability to store acquired knowledge into long-term memory.  This memory
impairment is highly relevant to students.  The risk of acute amnesia is
more pronounced with short-acting drugs.  Ativan (lorazepam), Halcion
(triazolam), Xanax (alprazolam) and Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) are especially
likely to induce such memory impairment.</p>
