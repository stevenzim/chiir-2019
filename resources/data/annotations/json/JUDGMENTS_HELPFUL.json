Mixing alcohol and benzos can impair judgment, significantly decrease mobility or control over one's own movements, and dramatically depress the central nervous system. This combined abuse can also place intense strain on the respiratory system and significantly impair breathing. One of the largest issues with prescribing benzodiazepines for legitimate illness is determining a patient's level and frequency of alcohol consumption.",
